# Personality & Emoji Enhancement Summary 🎭🔥

## What We Did

We TRANSFORMED the A2A agents from boring draft bots into **ENTERTAINING CHARACTERS** with distinct personalities and emoji styles!

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **EXTREME Personalities** 🚀
- Each agent now has an OVER-THE-TOP personality that matches their strategy
- They use CAPS, bold statements, and dramatic language
- Their philosophies are taken to the ABSOLUTE EXTREME

### 2. **Strategic Emoji Usage** 😈
- Each agent has a unique emoji style that reinforces their identity:
  - **Zero RB**: ✈️💨🏥 (air raid + mocking injuries)
  - **Value Vulture**: 🦅📊📈 (predator + analytics)
  - **Ground & Pound**: 💪🚜💥 (strength + bulldozing)
  - **Chaos Agent**: 🎰🚀💣 (gambling + explosions)
  - **Algorithm Assassin**: 🤖💻📉 (tech + opponent failure)

### 3. **Enhanced Prompts** 💥
- Pick prompts: "🚨 IT'S YOUR TIME TO DOMINATE! 🚨"
- Comment prompts: "🎯 DESTROY them with your superior knowledge! 💥"

### 4. **Memorable Interactions** 🎪
- Trash talk is now SAVAGE and PERSONAL
- Comments reference previous interactions with SPITE
- Rivalries ESCALATE throughout the draft

## The Result

**Before:** 😴
