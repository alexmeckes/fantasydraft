# Multi-Agent Mock Draft Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What We Built

We've created a sophisticated multi-agent mock draft system that demonstrates:

### 1. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication**
- Agents directly communicate with each other
- Natural conversation flow: "📙 Team 3 → 📘 Team 1: Leaving McCaffrey on the board? That's a mistake!"
- Agents respond to each other's comments
- Dynamic dialogue based on draft decisions

### 2. **Multi-Turn Memory**
- Each agent remembers previous conversations
- References earlier statements: "Like I said, enjoy the injury risk"
- Tracks other agents' strategies
- Influences future decisions based on past interactions

### 3. **Visual Clarity**
- Each agent has unique color-coded styling:
  - 📘 Blue boxes for Team 1 (Zero RB)
  - 📗 Green boxes for Team 2 (BPA)
  - 📙 Orange boxes for Team 3 (Robust RB)
  - 📕 Red boxes for User's Advisor
  - 📓 Yellow boxes for Team 5 (Upside)
  - 📜 Gold boxes for Commissioner

### 4. **Strategic AI Agents**
Each agent has distinct behavior:
- **Zero RB Agent**: Prioritizes WRs early, comments on RB injury risk
- **BPA Agent**: Takes best available, comments on value/reaches
- **Robust RB Agent**: Loads up on RBs, criticizes Zero RB approach
- **Upside Agent**: Hunts for breakout players, takes risks
- **User Advisor**: Provides contextual advice based on draft flow

  📘 Team 1 → Team 3
  RBs get injured. I'll take my chances with elite WRs.
</div>
```

### Memory Indicators
```
💭 DRAFT MEMORY (Round 2)
• Team 1 committed to Zero RB strategy
• Team 3 prefers RB-heavy approach
• Teams are aware of each other's strategies
```

### Draft Board Visualization
```
| Team     | Round 1    | Round 2    | Round 3    |
