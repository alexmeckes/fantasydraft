# Fantasy Draft Timing & UX Improvements

## Overview
Implemented improvements to make the multi-agent draft experience more readable and engaging by controlling the flow of information.

## Key Changes

### 1. Limited Comments (2-3 per pick)
- Smart selection of which agents comment based on:
  - **Priority 1**: Next drafter in the snake order
  - **Priority 2**: Agents with opposing strategies (Zero RB vs Robust RB)
  - **Priority 3**: Random agent if pick is controversial
- Controversial picks (reaches, position runs) trigger more discussion

### 2. Typing Indicators
- Shows "ðŸ’­ *Team X is typing...*" before each message
- Creates anticipation and natural conversation flow
- Styled with subtle fade animation

### 3. Staggered Message Display
- 0.5 second delay for typing indicators
- 1.0 second delay between actual messages
- Gives users time to read each comment
- Creates more natural conversation rhythm

### 4. Smart Comment Selection Algorithm
- `is_pick_controversial()` - Detects reaches and position runs
- `select_commenters()` - Chooses 2-3 most relevant agents
- `get_draft_order()` - Handles snake draft logic

## Benefits
- **Reduced Information Overload**: From 4-5 comments to 2-3 per pick
- **Natural Pacing**: ~3-5 seconds between messages
- **Strategic Relevance**: Comments come from agents most affected
- **Better Readability**: Users can follow conversations easily

## Implementation Details
- Modified `multiagent_draft.py` to add smart selection
- Updated `app.py` to handle delays and animations
- Enhanced `multiagent_scenarios.py` for typing indicators
- Added CSS animations for visual polish
