# Task ID Implementation Summary

## What We Did

We successfully enhanced the A2A implementation in `app_enhanced.py` to use **Task IDs** for maintaining conversation context between agents. This enables much better trash talk and more engaging agent interactions.

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Task ID Tracking
```python
self.task_ids = {}  # Track task IDs per agent
self.conversation_history = {}  # Store interaction history
```

### 2. Enhanced Agent Instructions
Agents now remember and reference previous interactions:
```python
"Remember previous interactions - reference past picks, comments, and trash talk when relevant.
Build rivalries and alliances based on what other teams say and do."
```

### 3. Context in Every Request
Each pick/comment request includes relevant history:
```python
context = "\nRecent history:\n" + "\n".join(recent_history[-3:])
```

### 4. Persistent Conversations
Task IDs are extracted and stored from responses:
```python
if 'task_id' in result:
    self.task_ids[team_num] = result['task_id']
```

## Benefits

- **Better Trash Talk**: "Remember when you said RBs don't matter? How's that working out?"
- **Ongoing Rivalries**: Agents build feuds over multiple rounds
- **Strategic References**: "You took my WR target, so I'm taking your RB!"
- **Personality Development**: Each agent's character evolves through interactions

## Running It

```bash
cd fantasy-draft-agent
source venv/bin/activate
python apps/app_enhanced.py
```

Visit http://localhost:7860 and toggle to "Real A2A Mode" to see contextual interactions!

## Example Output

**Without Task IDs:**
- Team 1: "Taking Jefferson, WRs rule!"
- Team 3: "McCaffrey is better."

**With Task IDs:**
- Team 1: "Taking Jefferson, WRs rule!"
- Team 3: "Another Zero RB fool. Remember this when your team crashes."
- Team 1 (Round 2): "CeeDee Lamb! Still think RBs matter more?"
- Team 3: "You passed on Ekeler? Your 'strategy' is showing its flaws!"

The agents now have **memory** and **personality** that develops throughout the draft!
