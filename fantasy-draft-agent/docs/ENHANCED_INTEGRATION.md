# Enhanced Agent Integration Guide

## Quick Integration Steps

### 1. Update multiagent_draft.py imports
Replace the existing agent class definitions with enhanced versions:

```python
# At the top of multiagent_draft.py, add:
from enhanced_multiagent_draft import (
    EnhancedDraftAgent as DraftAgent,
    EnhancedZeroRBAgent as ZeroRBAgent,
    EnhancedBPAAgent as BPAAgent,
    EnhancedRobustRBAgent as RobustRBAgent,
    EnhancedUpsideAgent as UpsideAgent
)
```

### 2. Add Random Emoji Reactions
In `simulate_draft_turn`, sometimes add pure emoji reactions:

```python
# After a controversial pick
if self.is_pick_controversial(player, pick_num) and random.random() > 0.6:
    # Random agent drops emoji bomb
    reactor = random.choice(list(self.agents.values()))
    emoji_storm = reactor.generate_emoji_storm("bad_pick")
    messages.append((reactor, "ALL", emoji_storm))
```

### 3. Enable Grudge Tracking
The enhanced agents automatically track grudges, but make sure to call `remember_conversation`:

```python
# In simulate_draft_turn, after each comment:
for agent in self.agents.values():
    agent.remember_conversation(speaker.team_name, message)
```

### 4. Add Meta Commentary
Occasionally have agents break the 4th wall:

```python
# Every 10th pick or so
if pick_num % 10 == 0 and random.random() > 0.7:
    meta_agent = random.choice(list(self.agents.values()))
    meta_comments = [
        "Is anyone else's algorithm telling them to be meaner? 🤖",
        "Why do I always end up in the most toxic draft rooms? 😅",
        "USER, PLEASE don't take my sleeper at pick 4 🙏",
        "This draft chat gonna end up on r/fantasyfootball 📸"
    ]
    messages.append((meta_agent, "ALL", random.choice(meta_comments)))
```

## Key Features of Enhanced Agents

### 1. Dynamic Emoji Usage
- Each agent has a signature emoji vocabulary
- Reactions change based on context (reach, steal, rivalry)
- Sometimes pure emoji responses: "😂😂😂💀"

### 2. Escalating Feuds
- Agents remember who dissed them
- Comments get spicier with each interaction
- Reference previous burns

### 3. Modern Language
- Memes and pop culture references
- Reddit/Twitter energy
- Gen Z slang when appropriate

### 4. Personality Traits
- **Zero RB**: Insufferably smug about injury stats
- **BPA**: Condescending professor energy
- **Robust RB**: Old-school tough guy
- **Upside**: Chaotic gambling addict
