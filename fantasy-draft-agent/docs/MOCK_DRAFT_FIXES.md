# Mock Draft Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Team 2 in Round 1
**Problem**: Team 2 was initialized but wasn't drafting in Round 1
**Solution**: Fixed the draft order logic to properly iterate through all 6 teams

### 2. Incorrect Pick Numbers
**Problem**: Draft was only counting 5 teams per round instead of 6
**Solution**: Updated all calculations to use 6 teams:
- Pick number calculation: `(round_num - 1) * 6 + pick_in_round`
- Round calculation: `total_picks // 6 + 1`
- Pick order ranges: `range(1, 7)` for all 6 teams

### 3. Snake Draft Not Working
**Problem**: Round 2 wasn't properly reversing the order
**Solution**: Fixed snake draft logic:
- Odd rounds (1, 3): Order is 1→2→3→4→5→6
- Even rounds (2): Order is 6→5→4→3→2→1

### 4. Missing User Team in Final Summary
**Problem**: Draft summary was incomplete
**Solution**: The get_draft_summary() method already included user's team, just needed proper draft completion

### 5. Round Count Issues
**Problem**: Advisor showing "Round 4 Advice" during Round 3
**Solution**: Fixed round calculation in UserAdvisorAgent to properly count based on total picks divided by 6 teams

### 6. Team 6 Not Initialized
**Problem**: Only 5 teams were playing (no Team 6)
**Solution**: Added Team 6 as a BPAAgent when user is at position 4
