# Comment Limiting Implementation ðŸ’¬

## Overview

We've implemented a smart comment limiting system that reduces comment spam while maintaining engaging interactions. Instead of allowing all 4-5 AI agents to comment on every pick, we now limit comments to **2 per pick** with intelligent selection.

## The Problem

**Before:** When any AI team made a pick, ALL other AI teams could comment:
- Team 1 picks â†’ Teams 2, 3, 5, 6 ALL comment (4 comments!)
- With enhanced personalities using emojis and CAPS, this was overwhelming
- Important comments got lost in the noise

## The Solution

### 1. **Comment Limit: 2 per pick**
- Maximum 2 agents can comment on any pick
- Configurable via `max_comments_per_pick` parameter
- Matches the simulated draft's behavior

### 2. **Smart Prioritization**

Comments are prioritized based on natural rivalries:

```python
rival_pairs = {
    1: 3,      # Zero RB vs Robust RB - natural enemies!
    3: 1,      # Robust RB vs Zero RB
    5: [2, 6], # Upside Hunter vs BPA agents
    2: 5,      # BPA vs Upside Hunter
    6: 5,      # BPA vs Upside Hunter
}
```

### 3. **Implementation**

```python
# A2A version
max_comments = self.a2a_manager.max_comments_per_pick  # Default: 2

# Prioritize rivals first
if team_num in rival_pairs:
    rivals = rival_pairs[team_num]
    # Put rivals at front of commenter list
    prioritized_commenters = [rivals] + [others]

# Collect up to limit
for other_team in prioritized_commenters:
    if comment_count >= max_comments:
        break
```

## Benefits

### Better Pacing ðŸŽ¯
- Draft flows more smoothly
- Less overwhelming for users
- Key comments stand out

### More Meaningful Interactions ðŸ’¡
- Natural rivals comment on each other
- Comments feel more targeted
- Less random noise

### Enhanced Drama ðŸŽ­
- Zero RB vs Robust RB battles are highlighted
- Upside Hunter vs BPA debates are featured
- Rivalries develop naturally

## Examples

### Before (4+ comments):
```
Team 1 picks Justin Jefferson
Team 2: "Solid value pick"
Team 3: "Should have taken a RB"
Team 5: "Too safe for my taste"
Team 6: "Good ADP value here"
```

### After (2 focused comments):
```
Team 1 picks Justin Jefferson
Team 3: "ðŸšœ ANOTHER Zero RB FOOL! When your WRs are on the bench injured, my RBs will be CRUSHING! ðŸ’¥"
Team 5: "ðŸŽ° Jefferson? BORING! Where's the UPSIDE? Enjoy your safe 4th place finish! ðŸ’£"
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```python
# In A2AAgentManager.__init__
self.max_comments_per_pick = 2  # Default
```

### Custom Limits
```python
# Create manager with custom limit
manager = A2AAgentManager(max_comments_per_pick=3)

# Or even 1 for minimal commentary
manager = A2AAgentManager(max_comments_per_pick=1)
```

## Simulated vs A2A Consistency

Both modes now use similar comment limiting:

| Feature | Simulated Draft | A2A Draft |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Max Comments | 2 (hardcoded) | 2 (configurable) |
| Prioritization | Next drafter + rivals | Rivals first |
| User picks | Always get comments | Always get comments |
| Skip chance | 50% on obvious picks | All agents can comment |

## Result

The draft experience is now:
- âœ… **More focused**: Key rivalries shine through
- âœ… **Less spammy**: 2 comments instead of 4-5
- âœ… **More dramatic**: Natural enemies face off
- âœ… **Better paced**: Easier to follow the action

Perfect for showcasing the enhanced personalities without overwhelming users! ðŸŽ¯
