# ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying your Fantasy Draft app, ensure:

## âœ… Required
- [ ] **OpenAI API Key** - You have a valid OpenAI API key
- [ ] **Test Locally** - App runs without errors locally
- [ ] **Dependencies** - All required packages in requirements.txt

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Files (Created by prepare_for_deployment.py)
- [ ] `app.py` - Main application
- [ ] `agent.py` - Agent framework
- [ ] `data.py` - Player data
- [ ] `multiagent_draft.py` - Multi-agent logic
- [ ] `multiagent_scenarios.py` - Agent communication
- [ ] `scenarios.py` - Draft scenarios
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [ ] `README.md` - Hugging Face Space metadata

## ðŸŽ¯ For Hugging Face Deployment
1. [ ] Create account at huggingface.co
2. [ ] Create new Space (Gradio SDK)
3. [ ] Clone Space repository
4. [ ] Copy files from `fantasy-draft-deploy/`
5. [ ] Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` as repository secret
6. [ ] Git push to deploy

## ðŸ’° Cost Considerations
- Each draft simulation uses ~10-15 API calls
- With GPT-4: ~$0.05-0.10 per draft
- Consider using GPT-3.5-turbo for demos (10x cheaper)
- Set up usage limits in OpenAI dashboard

## ðŸ”’ Security
- Never commit `.env` files with API keys
- Use repository secrets for sensitive data
- Consider rate limiting for public deployments

## ðŸŽ‰ Post-Deployment
- Test the live URL
- Share with friends/community
- Monitor usage and costs
- Gather feedback for improvements
