# Apps Directory

This directory contains the main application and supporting modules:

## Main Files

- **`app.py`** - The main Gradio web interface with full A2A support
- **`multiagent_draft.py`** - Core draft logic and agent management 
- **`multiagent_scenarios.py`** - UI formatting, visualization, and agent communication

## Notes

- The main entry point for the application is `/fantasy-draft-agent/app.py` which imports from this directory
- Previously there were two versions (app.py and app_enhanced.py) but they have been consolidated
- The `.bak` file is a backup of the older version without A2A support
