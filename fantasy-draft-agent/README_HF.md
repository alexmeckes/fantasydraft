# üèà Fantasy Draft Multi-Agent Demo

Experience AI agents with distinct personalities competing in a fantasy football draft! You play as Team 4 with an AI advisor.

## Features

- **6 AI Agents** with unique strategies (Zero RB, Best Player Available, Robust RB, etc.)
- **Two Communication Modes**:
  - **Basic Multiagent**: Fast, single-process execution
  - **A2A Mode**: Distributed agents on HTTP servers (limited on free tier)
- **Interactive Participation**: Draft alongside AI with strategic advice
- **Real-time Communication**: Agents comment and react to picks
- **Multi-User Support**: Each user gets their own draft session

## Setup

1. Add your OpenAI API key in **Settings ‚Üí Repository secrets** as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. The app will start automatically once deployed

## Note on A2A Mode

A2A mode requires ports 5000-9000 for agent servers. On Hugging Face Spaces free tier, port availability may be limited. If A2A mode fails, the app will suggest using Basic Multiagent mode instead.

## About

Built with the [any-agent](https://github.com/any-agent/any-agent) framework, showcasing how modern LLMs can create engaging multi-agent experiences.
