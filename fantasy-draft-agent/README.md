# 🏈 Fantasy Draft Agent MVP

An AI-powered fantasy football draft assistant built with [any-agent](https://github.com/any-agent/any-agent) framework. This MVP demonstrates multi-turn conversation capabilities through pre-crafted scenarios, showcasing how AI can maintain context and provide strategic draft advice.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintains context across multiple interactions
- **Strategic Draft Advice**: Provides recommendations based on draft position and available players
- **Position Analysis**: Evaluates scarcity and tier breakdowns
- **Team Stacking**: Identifies QB-receiver correlations
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time draft assistance
- **Demo Scenarios**: 4 pre-built scenarios showcasing different capabilities
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful Gradio UI for easy interaction
- **Multi-Agent Mock Draft**: Watch AI agents communicate and compete in a live draft

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM API)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd fantasy-draft-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your API key (recommended method):
```bash
# Create .env file from template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
# The file should contain:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Alternative method (less secure):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

### Test Installation

```bash
python demo.py --test
```

## 🔑 API Key Setup

The app uses `python-dotenv` to automatically load your API key from a `.env` file:

1. **Create `.env` file**: `cp .env.example .env`
2. **Edit `.env`**: Add your key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxx`
3. **Never commit `.env`**: It's already in `.gitignore`

See [ENV_SETUP.md](ENV_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## 🎮 Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

Launch the Gradio web interface for the best experience:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:7860 in your browser.

The web interface includes:
- **💬 Draft Assistant**: Interactive chat with context retention
- **📊 Player Analysis**: Compare players and analyze positions
- **🎯 Available Players**: Browse and filter available players
- **🎬 Demo Scenarios**: Run pre-built conversation scenarios
- **📋 Draft Board**: View the current draft state

### Command Line Interface

Quick demo:

```bash
python demo.py --quick
```

Interactive mode:

```bash
python demo.py --interactive
```

Commands in interactive mode:
- Ask any draft question
- `pick <player>` - Draft a player
- `roster` - View your current roster
- `reset` - Start a new draft
- `quit` - Exit

Run demo scenarios:

```bash
python demo.py --scenario 1  # Run "The Opening Pick" scenario
python demo.py --all-scenarios  # Run all scenarios
```

## 🎮 Running Demos

### Basic Demo
```bash
python demo.py
```

### Multi-Turn Demos
```bash
# Standard real-time demo (with typewriter effects)
python demo_simple_realtime.py

# Clean mode (no typewriter effects - recommended for some terminals)
python demo_simple_realtime.py --clean

# Alternative clean demo
python demo_clean_multiturn.py

# Rich visual demo (requires: pip install rich)
python demo_realtime.py
```

### Web Interface
```bash
python app.py
# Then open http://localhost:7860
```

### Troubleshooting
If you see garbled output with repeated text like "I havI have theI have the 5th...", use the clean mode:
```bash
python demo_simple_realtime.py --clean
```

## 📚 Demo Scenarios

1. **The Opening Pick** - User has 5th pick, top 4 players gone. Shows strategy adaptation.
2. **The Position Run** - Round 3, QB run happening. Shows patience and value finding.
3. **The Sleeper Question** - Round 10, looking for upside. Shows deep knowledge.
4. **The Stack Builder** - Has Mahomes, wants receivers. Shows correlation strategy.

### Key Components

- **FantasyDraftAgent**: Main agent class with conversation memory
- **Tools**: Player stats, best available, position analysis, stacking options
- **ScenarioRunner**: Manages and executes demo scenarios
- **Visualizer**: Creates ASCII player cards and draft boards
- **FantasyDraftApp**: Gradio interface wrapper

## 💡 Example Usage

```python
from agent import FantasyDraftAgent

# Create agent
agent = FantasyDraftAgent()

# Ask for advice
response = agent.run("I have the 5th pick. Who should I target?")
print(response)

# Follow-up question (maintains context)
response = agent.run("What about in round 2?")
print(response)
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Change the LLM Model

Edit `agent.py`:

```python
self.agent = AnyAgent.create(
    framework="openai",  # or "langchain", "llama_index", etc.
    AgentConfig(
        model_id="gpt-4",  # Change model here
        # ...
    )
)
```

### Add More Players

Edit `data.py` to add more players to the `TOP_PLAYERS` dictionary.

### Create New Scenarios

Add new scenarios to `SCENARIOS` in `scenarios.py`.

### Customize the Web Interface

Edit `app.py` to modify the Gradio interface, add new tabs, or change the styling.
